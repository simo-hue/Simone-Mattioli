&lt;p>Solitude is a precious space to get in touch with ourselves. When we are alone, without distractions, we can listen to our thoughts and discover who we really are. What makes us happy?

These are questions that we rarely find the time to address, but which can guide us towards a more authentic life.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>

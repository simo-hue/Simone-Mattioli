&lt;p>Recently, thanks to my project &lt;em>Mountain Fauna Lover&lt;/em>, I had the chance to participate in an exclusive event organized by SWAROVSKI OPTIK Italy at the stunning Frassino Oasis in Peschiera del Garda.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Mountain Fauna Lover&lt;/em> began almost as a joke, born from my love for mountains and wildlife. I never imagined it would open doors to such exciting collaborations.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Through this project, I’ve been able to experience nature up close, often alongside experts and using top-tier equipment, making each adventure more unforgettable than the last.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Mountain Fauna Lover</title><link>https://simo-hue.github.io/03_projects/mountain-fauna-lover/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://simo-hue.github.io/03_projects/mountain-fauna-lover/</guid><description>&lt;p>Welcome to MountainFaunaLover!

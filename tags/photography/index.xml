&lt;p>We live in an era where technology allows us to capture moments in high quality simply with a smartphone. I don&amp;rsquo;t want to waste this opportunity! In fact, I think it&amp;rsquo;s fantastic to be able to record and share pieces of my life that, otherwise, would only remain in memory. With Simo&amp;rsquo;s Diary, not only can I collect these memories for the future, but also share them with anyone who wants to follow them and maybe find inspiration.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>

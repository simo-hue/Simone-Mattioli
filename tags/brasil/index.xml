&lt;p>My volunteer experience in Brazil was an unforgettable journey that led me to discover not only a country rich in culture, but also the daily challenges faced by people in vulnerable situations.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We left in seven, a heterogeneous group composed of six strangers from different Italian cities: Verona, Padua and Rome. The experience was organized by &lt;strong>Collegio Di Merito Don Mazza&lt;/strong>, an institution that promotes social commitment and volunteering as well as providing accommodation for university students.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>

My educational journey began at ITT Marconi in Rovereto, where I discovered my passion for computer science and technology. This prestigious institution provided a strong foundation in technical subjects, enabling me to explore various aspects of computing while honing my analytical and problem-solving skills.

At ITT Marconi, I was immersed in a curriculum that balanced theory with practical application. Courses in programming, computer networks, and electronics sparked my interest and challenged me to think critically about how technology influences our daily lives. The hands-on projects and collaborative environment encouraged me to work alongside my peers, fostering teamwork and communication skills that are essential in today’s tech landscape.

Beyond the classroom, ITT Marconi offered a variety of extracurricular activities, including coding clubs and competitions, which further fueled my enthusiasm for technology.

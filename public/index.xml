        <title>Spread Love wherever you go</title>
        <link>http://localhost:1313/02_thought/love.html</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 06 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>http://localhost:1313/02_thought/love.html</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/02_thought/love/image.png" alt="Featured image of post Spread Love wherever you go" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kindness is one of those little gestures that make days brighter, both for the giver and the receiver. I have always found comfort in being kind to others, even in the simplest actions. A smile, a greeting, a “how are you?” may seem insignificant, but they often have a profound impact. They are small acts that cost nothing, but that bring enormous wealth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like to think that every little kindness is a seed of happiness that spreads around us. From holding a door open for those who follow, to giving a coin to someone in need, to giving a smile to someone in need. These gestures not only make others feel better, but they also fill my heart with joy. And more often than not, I realize that, without even wanting to, I have given a smile to someone else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember with particular affection an episode that happened during a visit to a museum in Palermo. As I was leaving, I greeted the ticket inspector who was near the door. He seemed surprised and thanked me with sincere gratitude. He said, &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;You were the only one who greeted me among those who came out.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt; Those words struck a chord with me. It was such a simple gesture, almost automatic for me, but for him it made a difference. It reminded me of how powerful a small kindness can be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, I believe the world needs more love and kindness. We shouldn&amp;rsquo;t expect grand gestures to make a difference; often it&amp;rsquo;s the simplest actions that leave a mark. As Mother Teresa said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Not all of us can do great things, but we can do small things with great love.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So why not start today? Spread love wherever you go.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The importance of being able to stay alone</title>
        <link>http://localhost:1313/02_thought/alone.html</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 06 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>http://localhost:1313/02_thought/alone.html</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/02_thought/alone/alone.png" alt="Featured image of post The importance of being able to stay alone" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Knowing how to be alone is an often underestimated skill, but it is incredibly important for our personal growth. In a world that seems to constantly push us to seek the company of others, taking time for ourselves can be a revolutionary act. Not only does it allow us to know ourselves better, but it can turn into a real training ground for growing as a person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;know-yourself&#34;&gt;Know Yourself
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Solitude is a precious space to get in touch with ourselves. When we are alone, without distractions, we can listen to our thoughts and discover who we really are. What makes us happy? What do we want from life? What are our values? These are questions that we rarely find the time to address, but which can guide us towards a more authentic life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;break-free-from-social-pressure&#34;&gt;Break Free from Social Pressure
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is not normal, nor necessary, to always be surrounded by people. We often feel obliged to be part of groups or situations that do not represent us, just for fear of being judged. Learning to be alone helps us break free from this social pressure. There is nothing wrong with taking time for yourself, saying no to things that don’t make you feel good, and reclaiming your independence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;becoming-independent-and-strong&#34;&gt;Becoming Independent and Strong
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When we learn to be comfortable alone, we become stronger. We no longer need to constantly lean on others to find security or happiness. This doesn’t mean closing ourselves off from the world, but being independent, knowing that our inner strength is enough to face life’s challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;harnessing-the-value-of-solitude&#34;&gt;Harnessing the Value of Solitude
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Solitude is fertile ground for creativity and reflection. When we give ourselves time to be alone, thoughts and ideas often emerge that we would never have had otherwise. However, these moments must be lived consciously. If we let ourselves be overwhelmed by negative stimuli, such as excessive use of social media, we risk turning solitude into isolation and, in the worst cases, depression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make the most of solitude, we must live it with intention: reading a good book, meditating, walking in nature or simply reflecting on ourselves. These moments can be incredibly regenerating and transformative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;solitude-as-a-gym-for-growth&#34;&gt;Solitude as a Gym for Growth
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Solitude is not an enemy, but an opportunity. It is a space that allows us to grow, to become more aware and to strengthen our independence. As Rainer Maria Rilke wrote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Solitude is like rain: it rises from the sea towards the evening, from distant and remote plains, it rises to the sky, which always possesses it.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking time for ourselves is a gift we can give ourselves, every day. Don&amp;rsquo;t be afraid of being alone: ​​that&amp;rsquo;s where you could discover the best version of yourself&amp;hellip;but I would also like to remind you that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not everyone is able to do it, but you must be one of them&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

        <title>Daniele Cassioli</title>
        <link>http://localhost:1313/02_thought/cassioli.html</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 05 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>http://localhost:1313/02_thought/cassioli.html</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/02_thought/cassioli/home.png" alt="Featured image of post Daniele Cassioli" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had the privilege of meeting Daniele Cassioli, and I can say that it was a deeply enriching experience. For those who don&amp;rsquo;t know him, Daniele is a blind Paralympic athlete, world champion in water skiing, author and motivational speaker. His story is an extraordinary example of how to transform difficulties into opportunities, and his way of life is a lesson that leads to reflection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;gratitude-for-opportunities&#34;&gt;Gratitude for Opportunities
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being a student at the Collegio di Merito Don Mazza in Verona is an opportunity that has allowed me to participate in significant events like this. Meetings like this are precious opportunities to grow and look at the world with different eyes. I can only be grateful for everything that this college offers me, not only in terms of training, but also in terms of inspiration and awareness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-daniele-cassioli-foundation&#34;&gt;The Daniele Cassioli Foundation
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Daniele is not only an athlete, but also the founder of an extraordinary reality: the &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.danielecassioli.it&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Daniele Cassioli Foundation&lt;/a&gt;. This organization is dedicated to supporting young people with disabilities, helping them discover and develop their potential through sports and educational activities. It is incredible to see how this foundation not only offers opportunities, but also contributes to changing society&amp;rsquo;s mentality towards disability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-deeper-awareness&#34;&gt;A Deeper Awareness
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meeting Daniele made me reflect on how often, as able-bodied people, we take many things for granted. His story taught me that it is not what we lack that defines who we are, but what we develop to overcome challenges. Daniele has honed extraordinary skills, demonstrating that difficulties can become strengths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;making-fun-of-ones-flaws&#34;&gt;Making Fun of One&amp;rsquo;s Flaws
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the aspects that struck me most about Daniele is his ability to make fun of his own flaws and misfortunes. This not only makes him incredibly charismatic, but it is also a life lesson: knowing how to laugh at ourselves allows us to live with more serenity and at peace with ourselves. His light-heartedness is contagious and shows that accepting one&amp;rsquo;s limits is the first step to overcoming them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;his-books-and-the-value-of-sport&#34;&gt;His Books and the Value of Sport
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Daniele is also the author of inspirational books. Among these, I read one of his texts and it struck me for the depth of his messages and the simplicity with which he manages to convey complex concepts. Furthermore, during our meeting, he underlined the importance of sport not only for physical health, but also for mental well-being and happiness. Sport is a great life teacher and a way to create authentic bonds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-social-role-of-great-impact&#34;&gt;A Social Role of Great Impact
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Daniele&amp;rsquo;s role in society is fundamental. He helps young people with disabilities to see a brighter future and not give up in the face of difficulties. In a world that tends to put labels, Daniele shows that you can live a full and fulfilling life, transmitting confidence and motivation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-importance-of-community-even-in-individual-sports&#34;&gt;The Importance of Community, Even in Individual Sports
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;An anecdote that struck me was the story of the trips to the competitions. Although water skiing is an individual sport, Daniele described how the trips were moments of fun and community. I particularly remember the episode of the 2 athletes in wheelchairs stuck in the room and Daniele who had to resolve the situation.
He showed me that even in individual sports there is room for sharing and friendship, making the experience even richer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meeting Daniele Cassioli was one of the most significant experiences I have ever lived, and I will carry his teachings with me. His story taught me to see life from a different perspective and to believe that difficulties are not a limit, but an opportunity to grow and live fully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I leave the live of the event here&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/02_thought/humility/image.png" alt="Featured image of post Don&#39;t Brag" /&gt;&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-importance-of-humility-but-without-losing-self-confidence&#34;&gt;The importance of humility, but without losing self-confidence
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Humility is one of the most appreciated and sought-after qualities, both in personal and professional life. Being humble helps us grow, learn from others and recognize that we do not always have all the answers. It allows us to approach people with respect, creating authentic relationships based on mutual esteem. But it is important to remember that, like all virtues, humility must also be cultivated with balance.

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;when-humility-becomes-a-limit&#34;&gt;When humility becomes a limit
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, there is an insidious risk that hides behind excessive humility. While on the one hand it can be a sign of maturity and wisdom, on the other it can turn into a trap that undermines self-confidence. Being excessively humble can lead to underestimating one&amp;rsquo;s abilities, to belittling one&amp;rsquo;s successes or even to avoiding opportunities for fear of not being &amp;ldquo;enough&amp;rdquo; to face them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a world where comparing ourselves to others is the order of the day, it is easy to fall into the trap of thinking that humility means self-deprecation or extreme modesty. But being humble does not mean belittling yourself, but rather recognizing your limits without losing sight of your strengths. Humility must coexist with a healthy dose of self-esteem.

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;cultivating-a-balance-humility-and-self-confidence&#34;&gt;Cultivating a balance: Humility and Self-Confidence
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ideal balance consists of recognizing your own value without falling into arrogance. We can be aware of our skills, celebrating successes with gratitude but without turning them into vanity. We must learn to recognize what we have achieved without feeling superior to others, but also without belittling our path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To achieve this balance, it is useful to ask yourself: &amp;ldquo;Am I rejecting this recognition because I am truly humble, or because I do not believe in myself enough?&amp;rdquo; Cultivating self-confidence does not mean becoming arrogant, but having the awareness of your own abilities to confidently face challenges and goals.

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;in-conclusion&#34;&gt;In Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Humility and self-confidence are not conflicting qualities, but two sides of the same coin. Being humble keeps us grounded in reality, but having self-confidence pushes us to dream bigger and face challenges without fear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Humility does not consist in thinking less of yourself, but in thinking less of yourself.” – &lt;em&gt;C.S. Lewis&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>History importance</title>
        <link>http://localhost:1313/02_thought/history.html</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 05 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>http://localhost:1313/02_thought/history.html</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/02_thought/history/history.png" alt="Featured image of post History importance" /&gt;&lt;h1 id=&#34;my-journey-from-hater-to-curious&#34;&gt;My Journey from Hater to Curious
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;I admit that history was my nemesis during my school years. When the professor entered the classroom and started talking about dates, battles and rulers, I felt lost. It all seemed so boring and distant from my reality. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t perceive the value of that knowledge: why on earth would I be interested in what had happened centuries ago?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the years, however, something changed. I began to realize my gaps, feeling ashamed of how little I knew about our past (not with others but with myself). I understood that ignoring history was not only an academic shortcoming, but a real limitation in understanding the world around me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;discovering-the-value-of-history&#34;&gt;Discovering the Value of History
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;What once seemed useless to me, today appears as a precious resource. Why? Because history is cyclical. Events of the past, in different forms, are still repeated today. If we look carefully, we can find surprising analogies between what happened in the past centuries and what is happening in the world today. Economic crises, social tensions, international conflicts: it seems that humanity is condemned to continually relive the same mistakes (and this makes me think a lot).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding history has given me an additional tool to interpret the present. The more I study past events, the more I realize that it is not just a matter of memorizing dates and names, but of recognizing patterns, dynamics and cycles that recur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;learning-from-the-mistakes-of-others&#34;&gt;Learning from the mistakes of others
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most valuable lessons I have learned is that history is not just a book of past facts, but a practical guide for the present and above all for the future. Observing how leaders of the past have moved, what decisions they have made (and what mistakes they have made), allows me to draw lessons that I can also apply in my life. I am not just talking about political or economic decisions, but also about how to deal with difficult or unexpected situations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a way, knowing history is like having a map of the territory: it helps you orient yourself, avoid obstacles and not repeat the same mistakes made by those who came before us. Learning from the mistakes of others is a way to save time and pain, taking advantage of the wisdom accumulated over the centuries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;my-commitment-to-improving&#34;&gt;My commitment to improving
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, I try to make up for lost time, also because nowadays ignorance is a choice given that you can watch documentaries for free, listen to podcasts that delve into historical events and many other contents are available to everyone. I can&amp;rsquo;t change my school past, but I can certainly enrich my present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s not an easy process: there are still times when I feel overwhelmed by all the information I don&amp;rsquo;t know. But I don&amp;rsquo;t let myself get discouraged. Every day that passes, I discover something new that helps me better understand the world I live in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Those who don&amp;rsquo;t know history are condemned to repeat it.” – &lt;em&gt;George Santayana&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And with this quote, I want to remind myself (and whoever reads) that the past is not just a lesson for historians, but an opportunity for each of us to grow and improve.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>repetition is the mother of all skills</title>
        <link>http://localhost:1313/02_thought/repetition.html</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 05 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>http://localhost:1313/02_thought/repetition.html</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/02_thought/repetition/i.png" alt="Featured image of post repetition is the mother of all skills" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s a timeless truth in the saying, &lt;em&gt;“Repetition is the mother of all skills.”&lt;/em&gt; It’s something I’ve come to embrace fully since I integrated a method that has completely transformed the way I learn and internalize concepts: &lt;strong&gt;the immersion method&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-the-immersion-method&#34;&gt;What is the Immersion Method?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The immersion method is exactly what it sounds like—a full, deep dive into the subject or skill you want to master. Instead of just skimming the surface or approaching learning sporadically, immersion means surrounding yourself with the material, over and over again, until it becomes second nature. It’s not just about repetition but also about consistency and engagement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s how I applied it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Daily Exposure&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I made sure to interact with the concepts every single day. Whether it was listening to a podcast, reading a book, taking notes, or even talking about it with others, I created a constant feedback loop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Active Repetition&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Instead of passively consuming material, I actively revisited it. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I reread the same books multiple times. Each read revealed something I missed the first time or offered new insights as my understanding deepened.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I rewrote my notes. This process helped reinforce the key points in my mind.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Practical Application&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Immersion wasn’t just theoretical. I put what I learned into practice in real-world scenarios, which solidified the knowledge in my subconscious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;from-subconscious-absorption-to-visible-results&#34;&gt;From Subconscious Absorption to Visible Results
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most incredible change I experienced was seeing how concepts that once felt elusive started to flow naturally. It’s as if they had seeped into my subconscious. I no longer had to think so hard to recall them; they were just &lt;em&gt;there&lt;/em&gt;, ready for use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, while studying personal development topics, I found that principles I’d been exposed to for weeks suddenly became part of my decision-making process. I didn’t have to remind myself to “stay present” or “focus on the process” anymore—it just happened. This transformation wasn’t magic; it was immersion at work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-repetition-is-crucial&#34;&gt;Why Repetition is Crucial
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Repetition isn’t boring; it’s foundational. Every time you revisit a concept:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You &lt;strong&gt;strengthen the neural pathways&lt;/strong&gt; in your brain, making recall faster and easier.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You see new perspectives that weren’t apparent the first time. A single read-through of a book or course can’t uncover all its wisdom.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s what I’ve learned about the power of repetition:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Books are meant to be reread.&lt;/strong&gt; Some of my favorite books have been revisited three or four times, and each time I gain new insights or reinforce old ones.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Learning never stops.&lt;/strong&gt; What seems redundant often turns out to be the foundation for mastery.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-impact-of-immersion-on-me&#34;&gt;The Impact of Immersion on Me
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The immersion method has had a profound effect on my growth, both personally and professionally. Not only have I seen results in terms of knowledge retention, but also in how I think and act. Concepts that I struggled to grasp now feel second nature, and my confidence has skyrocketed because I trust in the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;final-thoughts-repetition-as-a-way-of-life&#34;&gt;Final Thoughts: Repetition as a Way of Life
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a world obsessed with novelty, we often undervalue repetition. But true mastery isn’t about skimming through countless books or ideas; it’s about deeply understanding and integrating a few. Immersion and repetition are how you turn knowledge into action and action into habits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, let me leave you with this:&lt;br&gt;
Revisit that book you love. Redo that course you enjoyed. Practice that skill over and over. You might be surprised by how much growth lies in going &lt;em&gt;deeper&lt;/em&gt;, not wider.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are your thoughts on repetition and immersion? Have you tried applying these principles to your learning or personal growth? Share your experiences below!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Atomic Habits | James Clear</title>
        <link>http://localhost:1313/06_books/atomic-habits.html</link>
        <pubDate>Mon, 04 Nov 2024 19:31:32 +0100</pubDate>
        
        <guid>http://localhost:1313/06_books/atomic-habits.html</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/06_books/atomic-habits/image.png" alt="Featured image of post Atomic Habits | James Clear" /&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Atomic Habits&amp;rdquo; by James Clear is an enlightening book that addresses the importance of habits in our daily lives. In a clear and accessible style, the author guides us through the cycle of habits, explaining how they influence our behavior and how we can use them to improve our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary-of-the-book&#34;&gt;Summary of the Book
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The heart of &amp;ldquo;Atomic Habits&amp;rdquo; is the explanation of how small, seemingly insignificant habits can accumulate over time to produce big results. The book provides a practical structure for building good habits and breaking bad ones, based on four fundamental laws: &lt;strong&gt;Cue, Craving, Response and Reward&lt;/strong&gt;. These elements make up the cycle of habits, a psychological process that determines our behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-cycle-of-habits-the-key-point-of-the-book&#34;&gt;The Cycle of Habits: The Key Point of the Book
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;James Clear teaches us that every habit follows a cycle composed of four main phases:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cue&lt;/strong&gt;: A stimulus that starts the habit. It can be something we see, hear or feel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Desire&lt;/strong&gt;: The motivation or impulse to do something. This is where the intention to act is born.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Response&lt;/strong&gt;: The action or behavior itself, which can be good or bad.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reward&lt;/strong&gt;: The positive (or negative) result that strengthens the likelihood of repeating that habit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-usefulness-of-habits&#34;&gt;The Usefulness of Habits
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Habits can be a very powerful tool if we know how to exploit them. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Create positive habits&lt;/strong&gt;: Getting used to reading every day even for just a few minutes can transform our cultural and mental life.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make changes sustainable&lt;/strong&gt;: Focusing on small but constant improvements (1% every day, as Clear suggests) can lead us to great progress in the long term.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;when-habits-become-dangerous&#34;&gt;When Habits Become Dangerous
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Habits are not always positive. If left unchecked, they can turn into harmful mechanisms, such as giving in to laziness or adopting self-destructive behaviors. The important thing, according to Clear, is to recognize these patterns and change them using the habit cycle as a tool for awareness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Atomic Habits&amp;rdquo; is not just a book about habits, but a real guide to personal growth. Learning to recognize and control the habit cycle allows us to build the life we ​​want, one small step at a time. It is a reading that I recommend to anyone who wants to improve themselves, both personally and professionally.&lt;/p&gt;

From a young age, I was mesmerized by the hum of engines, the thrill of watching cars fly by on the road, and the unmistakable connection I felt with each machine. Here, I dive into everything that makes cars more than just vehicles—from the technical finesse of engineering to the pure adrenaline sparked by the sound of a finely-tuned engine. Join me as I explore the art, performance, and culture of cars, where every drive feels like a shared heartbeat between driver and machine.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>guida ai bias cognitivi, Capire le Trappole della Mente | Raffaele Gaito</title>
        <link>http://localhost:1313/06_books/bias-cognitivi.html</link>
        <pubDate>Mon, 04 Nov 2024 19:31:32 +0100</pubDate>
        
        <guid>http://localhost:1313/06_books/bias-cognitivi.html</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/06_books/bias-cognitivi/image.png" alt="Featured image of post guida ai bias cognitivi, Capire le Trappole della Mente | Raffaele Gaito" /&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Cognitive Bias Guide&lt;/em&gt; is a book that helps us discover and understand the mechanisms that influence our thinking and decisions. Cognitive biases are systematic errors that we all make in reasoning, often without realizing it. This book offers practical examples and ideas to recognize and address these mental traps, allowing us to improve our decision-making process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;book-summary&#34;&gt;Book Summary
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Cognitive Bias Guide&lt;/em&gt; explores how our mind simplifies reality to save energy, but at the cost of introducing distortions in reasoning. It explains why cognitive biases develop and how they affect different aspects of our lives, from everyday choices to important decisions. Among the biases covered, we find:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Confirmation bias&lt;/strong&gt;: The tendency to seek information that confirms our beliefs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Dunning-Kruger effect&lt;/strong&gt;: The overestimation of one&amp;rsquo;s own skills by those with little experience in a field.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Loss Aversion&lt;/strong&gt;: The tendency to fear losses more than we value gains.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;understanding-cognitive-biases-the-key-point-of-the-book&#34;&gt;Understanding Cognitive Biases: The Key Point of the Book
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The book shows us how cognitive biases are the result of heuristics, or mental shortcuts that the brain uses to deal with the complexity of the world. These shortcuts, while on the one hand helping us save time, on the other hand can lead us to incorrect conclusions or suboptimal choices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;examples-of-cognitive-biases&#34;&gt;Examples of Cognitive Biases
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Confirmation Bias&lt;/strong&gt;: Imagine wanting to buy a new smartphone and only reading reviews that speak positively of it, ignoring the negative ones.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Availability Heuristic&lt;/strong&gt;: Estimating the probability of an event based on easily remembered examples, such as thinking that plane crashes are more frequent than they actually are just because we hear about them on the news.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Framing Effect&lt;/strong&gt;: Changing your opinion on a proposal based on how it is presented (for example, preferring a product &amp;ldquo;90% fat free&amp;rdquo; to one &amp;ldquo;with 10% fat&amp;rdquo;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;why-is-it-important-to-recognize-them&#34;&gt;Why is it Important to Recognize Them?
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being aware of cognitive biases allows us to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Avoid recurring errors&lt;/strong&gt;: For example, we can reduce the impact of confirmation bias by actively seeking opposing points of view.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Improve decisions&lt;/strong&gt;: In both our personal and professional lives, recognizing our biases makes us more objective.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Promote critical thinking&lt;/strong&gt;: Becoming more aware of our cognitive limitations pushes us to think more deeply.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Guide to Cognitive Biases&lt;/em&gt; is an essential book for anyone who wants to improve their mental awareness and make more informed decisions. It is an inspiring read, full of examples that invites us to examine the way we think and discover how to avoid the most common mental traps.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>ignorance nowadays is a choice</title>
        <link>http://localhost:1313/02_thought/ignorance-today.html</link>
        <pubDate>Mon, 04 Nov 2024 19:31:32 +0100</pubDate>
        
        <guid>http://localhost:1313/02_thought/ignorance-today.html</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/02_thought/ignorance-today/al.png" alt="Featured image of post ignorance nowadays is a choice" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the past, access to knowledge was a privilege. Books were scarce, universities were reserved for the elite, and expertise often required access to specialized mentors or tools. But today, the story is completely different. We live in an era where the barriers to learning have all but disappeared, thanks to the transformative power of technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-gift-of-unlimited-access&#34;&gt;The Gift of Unlimited Access
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The internet, smartphones, and countless platforms like YouTube, Coursera, Udemy, and even Wikipedia have democratized information. Want to master photography? There&amp;rsquo;s a free tutorial for that. Fascinated by astrophysics? Enroll in an online course taught by a renowned professor. Curious about coding? Interactive coding platforms and forums can turn you into a developer from the comfort of your home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This unprecedented access means that anyone with a genuine passion and determination can become an expert in virtually any field. The tools are there, waiting to be used. Ignorance, in many ways, is no longer an excuse. It has become a choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-challenge-information-overload&#34;&gt;The Challenge: Information Overload
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, with great access comes great responsibility. The same internet that empowers us is also flooded with misinformation, half-truths, and outright falsehoods. Separating valuable, accurate knowledge from noise has become a skill in itself. Critical thinking and a skeptical eye are essential for navigating this sea of information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are a few tips to ensure you&amp;rsquo;re learning from reliable sources:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Check the credentials&lt;/strong&gt; of the author or creator. Are they an expert in the field?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cross-reference information&lt;/strong&gt; across multiple reputable sources.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Look for peer-reviewed or fact-checked content.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beware of biases&lt;/strong&gt;, especially in sensational or overly opinionated materials.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-future-of-self-education&#34;&gt;The Future of Self-Education
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As technology continues to evolve, so will the tools for self-education. Artificial intelligence, virtual reality, and augmented reality are already shaping the way we learn, making it more interactive and immersive. But one thing remains constant: the drive to learn must come from within.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By embracing the resources at our fingertips and being mindful of the content we consume, we can unlock boundless potential. The only question left is: what will you choose to learn today?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;The beautiful thing about learning is that no one can take it away from you.&amp;rdquo; – B.B. King&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

        <title>il grifone | Nicola Gratteri</title>
        <link>http://localhost:1313/06_books/gratteri.html</link>
        <pubDate>Mon, 04 Nov 2024 19:31:32 +0100</pubDate>
        
        <guid>http://localhost:1313/06_books/gratteri.html</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/06_books/gratteri/image.png" alt="Featured image of post il grifone | Nicola Gratteri" /&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Il Grifone&lt;/em&gt;, written by Nicola Gratteri, is a work that goes beyond the simple narration of the fight against organized crime. This book represents a true manifesto of dedication to justice, embodied by the author himself. Gratteri, magistrate and symbol of the fight against the &amp;rsquo;ndrangheta, dedicates every moment of his life to this mission, sacrificing his personal time and the comforts that his position could guarantee him (a characteristic that fascinates me a lot).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;book-summary&#34;&gt;Book Summary
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Il Grifone&lt;/em&gt; tells stories of corruption, organized crime and the constant challenge to defend the rule of law. Gratteri does not limit himself to describing the mechanisms of the &amp;rsquo;ndrangheta: he also illustrates the strategies to fight it, highlighting the importance of a strong, cohesive and determined judiciary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The title of the book, symbolic and evocative, refers to a mythological creature that represents vigilance and strength: qualities that well describe Gratteri himself in his daily commitment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;nicola-gratteri-a-fascinating-comparison-with-paolo-borsellino&#34;&gt;Nicola Gratteri: A Fascinating Comparison with Paolo Borsellino
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reading &lt;em&gt;Il Grifone&lt;/em&gt; and listening to interviews with Nicola Gratteri, it is impossible not to notice a parallel with figures such as Paolo Borsellino. Like Borsellino, Gratteri has chosen to dedicate every aspect of his life to working for justice, sacrificing his personal life and giving up many privileges to remain faithful to his mission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;total-dedication&#34;&gt;Total Dedication
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nicola Gratteri lives under escort, constantly aware of the risks that his role entails. However, he does not seek recognition or indulgence: his commitment is driven by a deep moral conviction and the desire to leave a better world for future generations. This dedication leads him to give up a private life and those moments of normality that many of us take for granted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;an-example-of-sacrifice-and-courage&#34;&gt;An Example of Sacrifice and Courage
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like Paolo Borsellino, Gratteri also demonstrates that justice is a value that requires absolute commitment. Both represent figures who put the collective good first, even at the cost of putting aside their own well-being and personal safety. This aspect makes their example not only admirable, but also deeply inspiring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-il-grifone-is-important&#34;&gt;Why &lt;em&gt;Il Grifone&lt;/em&gt; is Important
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This book is not only a work of denunciation, but also a reflection on how dedication and sacrifice are necessary to face seemingly insurmountable challenges. Gratteri not only describes the reality of organized crime, but invites us to reflect on the collective responsibility in building a more just society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nicola Gratteri, through &lt;em&gt;Il Grifone&lt;/em&gt;, does not only give us an account of the fight against the &amp;rsquo;ndrangheta, but a life lesson. His dedication recalls that of Paolo Borsellino, becoming an example of sacrifice, courage and integrity. This book is essential reading for anyone who wants to understand the price and value of justice.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Life Appreciation</title>

        <guid>http://localhost:1313/02_thought/gratitude.html</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/02_thought/gratitude/grateful.jpeg" alt="Featured image of post Life Appreciation" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;We often live in a rush, projected towards new goals and expectations. In this vortex, we can take for granted what we have: our health, our family, the people who love us, or even the simple warmth of the sun on our skin. Yet, when we learn to stop and really “see” these things, we discover a source of serenity and strength that can change our way of living.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-beauty-of-everyday-life&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Beauty of Everyday Life&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being grateful does not only mean recognizing great achievements or resounding successes, but also stopping to observe what surrounds us. It may seem trivial, but appreciating a morning coffee, a sincere smile, or the hug of a dear friend has immense value. These moments remind us that happiness does not lie in great events, but in the sum of many small moments lived with awareness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The simplest things, often the quietest, are those that resonate most within us.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;gratitude-for-health-and-relationships&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gratitude for Health and Relationships&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health is one of the most precious gifts we possess and that we usually tend to notice only when it is lacking. Practicing gratitude for our body and its ability to allow us to live and experience is a first step towards a deeper appreciation of ourselves and life. Relationships, whether they are family or friends, give us the opportunity to feel understood, supported and loved. And this too is never a given.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-power-of-nature-sunsets-the-sun-and-the-cycle-of-the-seasons&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Power of Nature: Sunsets, the Sun and the Cycle of the Seasons&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The natural world is full of beauty and wonder, and just taking a few minutes to observe it can instantly make you feel more serene and grounded. Watching a sunset, feeling the wind on your skin, or perceiving the warmth of the sun helps us reconnect to the present and appreciate the simplicity of life. These moments do not require money or status; they are there, every day, for anyone who wants to stop and experience them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-journey-of-gratitude-a-growth-path&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Journey of Gratitude: A Growth Path&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I came to these thoughts thanks to some personal growth courses that I took. In particular, one of the courses that had a significant impact on me was &lt;em&gt;Optimism and Resilience&lt;/em&gt; by Nicoletta Stella, which I attended during my time at the Collegio di Merito Don Mazza in Verona. This course helped me develop a more open and resilient mindset, making me understand how important it is to appreciate every aspect of life, even in difficult moments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;gratitude-practices-in-daily-life&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gratitude Practices in Daily Life&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For anyone who wants to start practicing gratitude, here are some practical tips:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Write a gratitude journal&lt;/strong&gt;: Every day, write down three things you are grateful for. They can be simple, like the food you ate or a pleasant conversation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stop and reflect&lt;/strong&gt;: Every time you feel a positive emotion, try to stop and live it fully, without thinking about what comes after.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Expressing Gratitude to Others&lt;/strong&gt;: Saying “thank you” to someone or letting them know how much they mean to you can improve not only your mood, but also the bond between you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life as a Gift&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion living appreciating what you have doesn’t mean not trying to improve yourself or reach new goals. It means remembering that every moment has a value and that we are part of a unique and unrepeatable experience. Being grateful for everyday things – from the bonds with those we love to the simple pleasures of nature – helps us cultivate a fuller and more satisfying life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Appreciating life means finding beauty even in simple moments, welcoming every moment as a gift, and recognizing that true happiness comes from gratitude for what we already have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Here, I’ll share stories, tips, and insights into the motorbike lifestyle, celebrating the pure adrenaline, skill, and connection that only bikers understand.

        <title>The 20th century Trap</title>
        <link>http://localhost:1313/02_thought/trap.html</link>
        <pubDate>Mon, 04 Nov 2024 19:31:32 +0100</pubDate>
        
        <guid>http://localhost:1313/02_thought/trap.html</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/02_thought/trap/traps.jpg" alt="Featured image of post The 20th century Trap" /&gt;&lt;h1 id=&#34;detached-from-stimuli&#34;&gt;Detached from stimuli
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;We live in an age of constant stimulation, a constant flow of notifications, updates and digital content that keep us constantly &amp;ldquo;connected&amp;rdquo; but, at the same time, drastically reduce our ability to concentrate. Every day, we are bombarded with visual and auditory stimuli through social media, messaging apps, entertainment platforms, which now guide our lives both online and offline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-loss-of-attention-span&#34;&gt;The Loss of Attention Span
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This situation scares me. I have noticed, especially during the pandemic, how much social media has taken on the role of &amp;ldquo;directors&amp;rdquo; of our lives. People talk about news, trends, and aspects of other people&amp;rsquo;s lives that they have learned on social media, as if these have replaced real experiences. Our attention span has reduced to almost absurd levels: we are incapable of standing in line or waiting without taking out our phones in search of new stimuli. This constant search for instant gratification through digital devices deprives us of the ability to fully live in the moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;an-incredibly-addicted-generation&#34;&gt;An Incredibly Addicted Generation
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a big difference compared to when I was a child. I remember with nostalgia the time spent playing outside, running in the parks and socializing with friends. Now I see parents who have to force their children to go out because, as soon as they can, young people prefer to stay sunk on the couch, immersed in devices. This cultural change is fueled by social media, which offers continuous doses of dopamine pleasure, generating an addiction similar to that of chemical substances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;first-step-awareness&#34;&gt;First Step: Awareness
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first step to free ourselves from this trap is to gain awareness. It is essential to understand how much social media and digital devices can suck us into their network, distancing us from real life and its most natural and authentic stimuli. If not managed with awareness, these tools can make us slaves to a virtual reality, making us lose connection with ourselves and with others in real life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-importance-of-being-bored&#34;&gt;The Importance of Being Bored
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being bored has become almost a taboo in modern society, but it is a practice that brings incredible benefits. Being bored is an opportunity to reflect, to let your mind wander and to reconnect with your creativity. It is a state that can bring out deep thoughts and new ideas, a precious space in which the mind frees itself from incessant stimuli and learns to regenerate itself. Learning to enjoy the absence of stimuli is essential to regaining our attention and living a more balanced life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, the next time you feel the temptation to grab your phone during a break, try to resist. Let your mind free itself from the need for constant stimuli, embrace boredom and allow yourself to return to a more natural rhythm. This is the only way we can escape the &amp;ldquo;Social Trap&amp;rdquo; and regain our mental freedom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, thanks to my project &lt;em&gt;Mountain Fauna Lover&lt;/em&gt;, I had the chance to participate in an exclusive event organized by SWAROVSKI OPTIK Italy at the stunning Frassino Oasis in Peschiera del Garda.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mountain Fauna Lover&lt;/em&gt; began almost as a joke, born from my love for mountains and wildlife. I never imagined it would open doors to such exciting collaborations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This time, we were immersed in an extraordinary birdwatching experience with expert guidance and SWAROVSKI OPTIK’s impressive tools, including the NL X52 binoculars and the BTX spotting scope. The day began with a presentation by SWAROVSKI OPTIK Italy’s manager, Franco Cernigliaro, and ornithologist Alessandro Sartori, who introduced us to the bird species we’d encounter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During my meeting with Franco Cernigliaro, the Country Manager of Swarovski Optik Italy, we exchanged inspiring ideas and perspectives on biodiversity and sustainability. It was a remarkable experience to engage with someone equally dedicated to nature and innovation. Our discussion centered on how these themes are fundamental to Swarovski’s mission—not just as marketing strategies but as true core values.
Swarovski Optik actively encourages deeper connections with nature and is committed to supporting sustainable practices and environmentally responsible technologies in their high-precision optics products&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The observation was incredible—Red-crested Pochards, Tufted Ducks, Teals, and, with a bit of luck, a Marsh Harrier—all appeared in their full beauty, enhanced by the sharpness and clarity of SWAROVSKI’s optics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This project has allowed me to build connections with companies like SWAROVSKI OPTIK and explore the world of wildlife in inspiring ways. Who knows what the future holds for &lt;em&gt;Mountain Fauna Lover&lt;/em&gt;… perhaps it will grow from a simple passion into something even greater. Stay tuned for more adventures!&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;th&gt;Time&lt;/th&gt;
          &lt;th&gt;Session&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;

          &lt;td&gt;Advanced GPU Optimization and Profiling (Continued)&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;12:30 - 14:00&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Lunch&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;14:00 - 17:30&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Lab Session (with your code or a provided code)&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hands-on lab in the afternoon provided an opportunity to implement what we learned using real-world examples, supported by the CINECA team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;day-3-4-intensive-lab-sessions&#34;&gt;Day 3-4: Intensive Lab Sessions
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The last two days were dedicated to &lt;strong&gt;intensive lab sessions&lt;/strong&gt;. Participants worked on challenging GPU computing projects, with mentors available to provide guidance and feedback. These sessions enabled us to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Test and debug our code using real-time feedback from experts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Engage in peer-to-peer learning, exchanging ideas and optimizing our implementations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Utilize &lt;strong&gt;Nsight&lt;/strong&gt; and other profiling tools to analyze performance and identify bottlenecks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;th&gt;Date&lt;/th&gt;
          &lt;th&gt;Morning (9:00 - 12:30)&lt;/th&gt;
          &lt;th&gt;Afternoon (14:00 - 17:30)&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;October 30&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Lab Session&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Lab Session&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;October 31&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Lab Session&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Lab Session&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;key-takeaways&#34;&gt;Key Takeaways
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This hackathon was more than just a technical event; it was a community-building experience. Here are some of the main takeaways:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Networking:&lt;/strong&gt; I had the opportunity to connect with like-minded individuals passionate about GPU programming and HPC.&lt;/li&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My volunteer experience in Brazil was an unforgettable journey that led me to discover not only a country rich in culture, but also the daily challenges faced by people in vulnerable situations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We left in seven, a heterogeneous group composed of six strangers from different Italian cities: Verona, Padua and Rome. The experience was organized by &lt;strong&gt;Collegio Di Merito Don Mazza&lt;/strong&gt;, an institution that promotes social commitment and volunteering as well as providing accommodation for university students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-cities-visited&#34;&gt;The Cities Visited
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;During our stay, we had the opportunity to explore different areas of Brazil, focusing mainly on Recife and João Pessoa, the largest cities we visited, before heading inland to Zumbi and Itapororoca. These cities are a vibrant mix of culture, history and traditions, but also of social challenges that have deeply affected us since our arrival.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;significant-moments&#34;&gt;Significant Moments
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It would be impossible to remember them all since the experience was characterized by moments of joy and just as many of emotional difficulty.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most touching memories was when we distributed food to people in need, an act that made us realize the critical reality in which many communities lived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also visited the communities of &lt;strong&gt;Olinda&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Alto do Mateus&lt;/strong&gt;, where we saw up close the precarious living conditions of the local people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had the opportunity to meet each member of their family, wonderful people who welcomed us with unprecedented openness and hospitality, which deeply touched me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The moment of saying goodbye was extremely difficult, as the bond that had been created was sincere and deep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, thanks to technology, we are still able to stay in touch, sharing moments and memories that unite us despite the distance.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without a doubt, my favorite project was &lt;strong&gt;Beira da Linha&lt;/strong&gt;. Here we assisted teachers in their lessons and I had the opportunity to interact with children and young people who attended after-school activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These young people, coming from difficult backgrounds, aspired to a better future, and my bond with them was extraordinary. The possibility of contributing to their educational journey was one of the most rewarding experiences of my life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And my greatest respect goes to these educators who dedicate their lives to improving that of the new generations&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During our stay there, as a tradition in Brazil, we played football a lot&amp;hellip;but the difference was that we were all playing barefoot on the concrete since they only had one pair of shoes, or sometimes not even those and therefore they couldn&amp;rsquo;t/didn&amp;rsquo;t want to ruin them&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back home, I can finally reflect on what I experienced and assimilate the messages and lessons learned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three months have passed since I returned, but the emotions and experiences I lived in Brazil continue to influence my daily life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We shared so much in only three weeks and when it comes to my mind it seems like a film&amp;hellip;too good to be true&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;contribution-to-projects--mazzian-ideals&#34;&gt;Contribution to Projects / Mazzian Ideals
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have actively participated in volunteer projects organized by &lt;strong&gt;Collegio Don Mazza&lt;/strong&gt;, with particular attention to education and social support initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During this experience, I collaborated on projects aimed at improving the socio-educational conditions of children and adolescents in disadvantaged areas, including after-school activities, creative and sports workshops, and literacy programs. I also had the opportunity to contribute to social inclusion and the promotion of the psychophysical well-being of young people, working in an intercultural exchange context that enriched my relational and organizational skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;soft-skills-development&#34;&gt;Soft Skills Development
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This experience has allowed me to develop important soft skills such as teamwork, leadership and problem solving skills. The daily challenges and the need to adapt to a new reality have taught me to collaborate effectively with others and to look for innovative solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;My volunteering experience in Brazil has been a journey of personal and professional growth that I would invite anyone to do, as I recommended during the seminars/meetings of presentation and testimony of the experience that I held together with my fellow adventurers in Rome, Padua and Verona.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would conclude with a phrase that &lt;strong&gt;Nelson Mandela&lt;/strong&gt; once said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Education is the most powerful weapon you can use.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This phrase perfectly encapsulates the essence of my journey and the meaning of the work we have done and the message that I tried to pass on to these young Brazilians. I hope to continue to carry forward the teachings of this experience and to contribute to the improvement of people&amp;rsquo;s lives, wherever I am.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>21th birth Day in Brazil</title>
        <link>http://localhost:1313/04_experiences/21th-birthday.html</link>
        <pubDate>Sun, 28 Jul 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>http://localhost:1313/04_experiences/21th-birthday.html</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/04_experiences/21th-birthday/olilnda.JPG" alt="Featured image of post 21th birth Day in Brazil" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;My 21st birthday was unique, an experience I will never forget. I spent it in Brazil, during my volunteering period, far from home and all my loved ones. On that occasion, I was not surrounded by the familiar faces of friends and relatives, but by six strangers, who shared with me the experience of volunteering in a country so different from mine.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did not expect anything special. Usually, birthdays have never had a particular meaning for me, but that day turned out to be different, special, unique. Celebrating a birthday far from home and loved ones was a first step out of my comfort zone. It allowed me to live the moment with lightness and curiosity, immersed in a new experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What made my birthday truly memorable was the surprise that my travel companions organized. They found out only a few days later that I had turned 18, and they decided to surprise me with a surprise that left me speechless. One morning we woke up at 4:30, ready to go and watch the sunrise on the beautiful Brazilian beach of Cabo Branco.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had no idea what to expect. We reached the beach, the sky was starting to turn warm, a prelude to dawn. It was then that they gave me a cake, prepared especially for me. We all shared it together, eating and enjoying the sunrise in one of the most beautiful places I have ever seen and then ending it in style with dinner with Don Eltom and Don Alberto who accompanied us on our volunteer experience in the Northeast of Brazil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;a-moment-of-pure-happiness&#34;&gt;A Moment of Pure Happiness
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In those moments of simplicity and friendship, I felt truly happy. It was a moment of pure connection, of gratitude towards life and towards these people who, even if they had just met, had made that day special. I realized how precious it was to step out of my patterns and embrace what is new and unexpected that life has to offer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;advice-from-the-heart&#34;&gt;Advice from the Heart
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If I can give you advice, it is to accept every experience that happens to you, even those that scare you or that seem difficult or &amp;ldquo;not made for you&amp;rdquo;. Those experiences will change you and make you grow. Getting out of your comfort zone, experiencing the world with openness and curiosity: these are the things that will give you unforgettable moments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That birthday away from home, in Brazil, taught me the value of sharing, friendship and adventure. It was an experience that I will always carry in my heart also with the other part of my journey there in Brazil doing volounteering activity&lt;/p&gt;

        <guid>http://localhost:1313/03_projects/home.html</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/03_projects/home/logo.jpeg" alt="Featured image of post Simo&#39;s Online &amp; Digital Diary" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Welcome to simo&amp;rsquo;s Diary, a place where I love to share&amp;hellip;.da completare&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;scopri-il-mio-canale-youtube-simos-diary&#34;&gt;Scopri il Mio Canale YouTube: Simo&amp;rsquo;s Diary
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oggi voglio parlarvi del mio canale YouTube, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/@SimosDiary2003&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Simo&amp;rsquo;s Diary&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, dove condivido momenti della mia vita, progetti personali e passioni. Questo spazio nasce dal desiderio di documentare le mie esperienze in modo autentico e trasparente, mostrandovi viaggi, avventure e molto altro ancora.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;perché-ho-creato-simos-diary&#34;&gt;Perché Ho Creato Simo&amp;rsquo;s Diary?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Viviamo in un&amp;rsquo;epoca in cui la tecnologia ci permette di catturare momenti in alta qualità semplicemente con uno smartphone. Non voglio sprecare questa opportunità! Anzi, penso sia fantastico poter registrare e condividere pezzi della mia vita che, altrimenti, resterebbero solo nella memoria. Con Simo&amp;rsquo;s Diary, non solo posso raccogliere questi ricordi per il futuro, ma anche condividerli con chiunque voglia seguirli e magari trovare ispirazione.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;cosa-troverai-su-simos-diary&#34;&gt;Cosa Troverai su Simo&amp;rsquo;s Diary
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nel mio canale troverai contenuti che raccontano la &lt;strong&gt;vita vera&lt;/strong&gt; di un ragazzo ambizioso, uno che è pronto a fare sacrifici per raggiungere i propri obiettivi. Voglio mostrarti il mondo senza filtri, lontano dalla perfezione che spesso vediamo online. Attraverso i miei video, ti porterò con me in viaggi, sfide e momenti quotidiani, con l&amp;rsquo;obiettivo di ricordare a me stesso e agli altri quanto sia importante apprezzare ogni cosa che la vita ci offre.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;temi-principali&#34;&gt;Temi Principali:
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gratitudine e Consapevolezza:&lt;/strong&gt; Ogni esperienza che condivido è un’opportunità per riflettere su ciò che abbiamo e per cui possiamo essere grati.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ambizione e Determinazione:&lt;/strong&gt; Simo&amp;rsquo;s Diary è anche la storia di un ragazzo che vuole tanto dalla vita e non ha paura di lottare per realizzare i suoi sogni.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Autenticità:&lt;/strong&gt; Non mi interessa mostrare una vita perfetta, ma piuttosto offrire un&amp;rsquo;immagine reale della mia esistenza, con le sue sfide, difficoltà e non solo i suoi traguardi.-&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Crescita personale&lt;/strong&gt; Il mio percorso e pensieri / skills che ho sviluppato durante questo processo&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pensieri&lt;/strong&gt; Quando mi viene in mente un pensiero, oppure inizio un ragionamento quando possibile inizio a registrare in modo tale da poter poi riascoltarmi anche in futuro e capire come la pensavo in un determinato momento della mia vita&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;un-invito-a-seguire-le-proprie-passioni&#34;&gt;Un Invito a Seguire le Proprie Passioni
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Con Simo&amp;rsquo;s Diary, voglio ispirarti a vivere pienamente e a usare le risorse che abbiamo oggi per creare qualcosa di significativo. La mia speranza è che i miei video possano spingerti a inseguire i tuoi obiettivi e a coltivare la gratitudine per le piccole cose della vita senza però dimenticarti la cosa che pià mi sta a cuore ultimamente, il fatto di &lt;strong&gt;godersi la vita&lt;/strong&gt;, quindi vivere ogni momento e sfida con il sorriso e gioia perchè il nostro periodo di permanenza su questa terra è molto limitato e non vale la pena scoraggiarsi e viversela male.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Se ti piace l&amp;rsquo;idea di scoprire avventure, riflessioni autentiche e la vita vera di un ragazzo che insegue i suoi sogni, visita il mio canale e iscriviti!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grazie per aver letto, e spero di vederti presto tra i miei follower su YouTube!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;rimani-in-contatto-con-me&#34;&gt;Rimani in contatto con me
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Seguimi su YouTube e sui social per rimanere aggiornato sulle mie avventure e scoprire di più sulla mia vita e i miei progetti!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

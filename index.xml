From a young age, I was mesmerized by the hum of engines, the thrill of watching cars fly by on the road, and the unmistakable connection I felt with each machine. Here, I dive into everything that makes cars more than just vehicles—from the technical finesse of engineering to the pure adrenaline sparked by the sound of a finely-tuned engine. Join me as I explore the art, performance, and culture of cars, where every drive feels like a shared heartbeat between driver and machine.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Life Appreciation</title><link>https://simo-hue.github.io/02_thought/gratitude.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Nov 2024 19:31:32 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://simo-hue.github.io/02_thought/gratitude.html</guid><description>&lt;p>We often live in a rush, projected towards new goals and expectations. In this vortex, we can take for granted what we have: our health, our family, the people who love us, or even the simple warmth of the sun on our skin. Yet, when we learn to stop and really “see” these things, we discover a source of serenity and strength that can change our way of living.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Being grateful does not only mean recognizing great achievements or resounding successes, but also stopping to observe what surrounds us. It may seem trivial, but appreciating a morning coffee, a sincere smile, or the hug of a dear friend has immense value. These moments remind us that happiness does not lie in great events, but in the sum of many small moments lived with awareness.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Motorbikes</title><link>https://simo-hue.github.io/05_passions/motorbike.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Nov 2024 19:31:32 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://simo-hue.github.io/05_passions/motorbike.html</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img alt="My Fantic 50 Motard" src="https://simo-hue.github.io/05_passions/motorbike/fantic.jpg">

&lt;p>We live in an age of constant stimulation, a constant flow of notifications, updates and digital content that keep us constantly &amp;ldquo;connected&amp;rdquo; but, at the same time, drastically reduce our ability to concentrate. Every day, we are bombarded with visual and auditory stimuli through social media, messaging apps, entertainment platforms, which now guide our lives both online and offline.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-loss-of-attention-span">The Loss of Attention Span&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This situation scares me. I have noticed, especially during the pandemic, how much social media has taken on the role of &amp;ldquo;directors&amp;rdquo; of our lives. People talk about news, trends, and aspects of other people&amp;rsquo;s lives that they have learned on social media, as if these have replaced real experiences. Our attention span has reduced to almost absurd levels: we are incapable of standing in line or waiting without taking out our phones in search of new stimuli. This constant search for instant gratification through digital devices deprives us of the ability to fully live in the moment.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Birdwatching Experience with SWAROVSKI OPTIK at Le Ali del Frassino Residence (Lake Frassino)</title><link>https://simo-hue.github.io/04_experiences/swarovski-optik-le-ali-del-frassino.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://simo-hue.github.io/04_experiences/swarovski-optik-le-ali-del-frassino.html</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img alt="Logo Swarovski Optik" src="https://simo-hue.github.io/04_experiences/swarovski-optik-le-ali-del-frassino/swarovski.jpeg">&lt;/p>

I spent it in Brazil, during my volunteering period, far from home and all my loved ones. On that occasion, I was not surrounded by the familiar faces of friends and relatives, but by six strangers, who shared with me the experience of volunteering in a country so different from mine.
&lt;img src="https://simo-hue.github.io/04_experiences/21th-birthday/spiaggia.png">
I did not expect anything special. Usually, birthdays have never had a particular meaning for me, but that day turned out to be different, special, unique. Celebrating a birthday far from home and loved ones was a first step out of my comfort zone. It allowed me to live the moment with lightness and curiosity, immersed in a new experience.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Mountain Fauna Lover</title><link>https://simo-hue.github.io/03_projects/mountainfaunalover.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://simo-hue.github.io/03_projects/mountainfaunalover.html</guid><description>&lt;p>Welcome to MountainFaunaLover!
